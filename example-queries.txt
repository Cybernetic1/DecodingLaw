1. Last Thursday, I bumped into a car at the red light near Nathan Road, the driver was injured. I need to know what I am liable for?

2. I live in a village and my neighbor is an old-fashioned woman who burns grass and leaves to make fertilizer for her farming.  The smoke spreads to my house and irritates our family's breathing.  Which laws may be relevant to this?

3. I injured my back while lifting some heavy documents in the office, but my boss won't compensate for this.
