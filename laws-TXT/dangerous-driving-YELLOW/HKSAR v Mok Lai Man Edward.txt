It was a scene worthy of a Hollywood movie. On 5 December 2016, at about 1740 hours, a police officer on motor cycle patrol first noticed a vehicle LD 8880 (the vehicle) parked in a restricted zone on Sunny Bay Road, Lantau. Upon closer inspection, he noticed its driver, Mr Mok Lai Man Edward (the defendant), appeared to be talking on the telephone. The policeman pulled over in front of the vehicle, upon which the vehicle drove off.
2. While the vehicle was travelling on Cheung Tung Road westbound, it swerved into the opposite lane (ie the eastbound lane) for 2 or 3 times. It passed by an intersection (ie Sham Shui Kok Drive), reversed and drove back into Sham Shui Kok Drive. It then made a right turn into Cheung Tung Road eastbound. The defendant's antics caused the policeman who had all along been travelling behind the vehicle to turn around and follow the vehicle, meanwhile sounding his horn and gesticulating its driver to stop, but the vehicle just sped on.
3. Thus began a 30 minute pursuit, covering a distance of 22 kilometres. It ended up with the defendant crashing the vehicle into a parapet strand along the Lantau Link, LD 8880.
4. During the pursuit, the defendant made the following manoeuvres:- 
 Along Cheung Tung Road westbound 
 (i) swerving into the opposite lane, ie, Cheung Tung Road eastbound, for two to three times;
 (ii) having driven past the intersection at the junction of Shum Shui Kok Drive, the defendant reversed back into the junction and then drove forward before turning back into Cheung Tung Road, this time travelling on the eastbound lane.

 (iii) ignoring the police officer's horn and gesticulations, instead keeping a speed of about 80 kilometres per hour along Sunny Bay Road towards Penny's Bay Highway;
 (iv) ignoring the police officer's hand signal to stop at a roadblock set up on the first lane of Sunny Bay Road, instead accelerating, driving onto the second lane to go past the roadblock. The defendant then executed two about turns and ended up going back on the same lane on Sunny Bay Road;
 (v) forcing through the same roadblock (now extended by police officers to cover the first and second lane) by driving between the first and second lane, in the process ramming into a coach (vehicle 1), a light goods vehicle (vehicle 2) and a police vehicle (vehicle 3) which were stationary at the roadblock. The defendant then took Penny's Bay Highway, passed the North Lantau Highway and then drove onto the Lantau Link.
