Criminal sentencing - causing death by dangerous     driving - causing grievous bodily harm by dangerous     driving - public light bus driver driven by defendant knocked down family of three at pedestrian crossing - aggravating factors 2. I have set out the facts of this case in some details in my statement of findings dated 2 June 2017 and I shall not repeat here. In essence, the defendant who was driving a public light bus knocked down a young couple and their 5-year-old daughter at a pedestrian crossing outside Maritime Square, Tsing Yi, New Territories. As a result, the father was serious injured and the daughter was also injured. Sadly, the mother suffered fatal injuries and was certified dead on the next day.
3. At the trial, the court convicted the defendant on both charges on the basis that he failed to keep a proper lookout of the road condition and drove at excessive speed (though not exceeded the speed limit).
