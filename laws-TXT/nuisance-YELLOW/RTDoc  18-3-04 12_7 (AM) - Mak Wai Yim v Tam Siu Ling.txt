Tort - nuisance - water seepage from premises to premises immediately below - source of seepage 2. The following background facts are not in dispute.
3. The plaintiffs have since 1999 been the registered owners of 1/F., No. 7 Shek Kip Mei Street, Sham Shui Po, Kowloon while the 1st defendant was the registered owner (from 2008 to 31 October 2011) and the 2nd defendant the current owner (since 31 October 2011) of a sub-divided unit on the 2nd floor of the same building ("Unit 2A").
4. The plaintiffs' unit is sub-divided into four rooms, all for rental purpose, and it is Room C ("Room 1C") and Room D ("Room 1D"), adjacent to each other, which are affected by water seepage. The bathroom of Unit 2A, which sits on what was originally a balcony, is immediately above the bathroom of Room 1D.
5. Water seepage in the ceiling of the bathroom of Room 1D was first reported by the tenant of Room 1D around October 2009. The plaintiffs complained to the Joint Office of the Buildings Department and the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department ("Joint Office") soon afterwards and filed a claim with the Small Claims Tribunal against the 1st defendant in December 2009. The plaintiffs alleged that water seepage extended to Room 1C in the meantime. In October 2010, the Joint Office concluded that the water seepage came from Unit 2A. The 1st defendant engaged a contractor to fix the problem in the same month. In June 2011, the 1st defendant settled the plaintiffs' claim at $38,500 payable by 6 instalments ("Settlement Sum").
6. In August 2011, the plaintiffs received yet another complaint of water seepage from the new tenant of Room 1D (whose two-year lease commenced in May 2011). On 23 August 2011, the 1st plaintiff and the 1st defendant jointly inspected Room 1D when the 1st defendant signed an undertaking whereby the 1st defendant promised to stop the water seepage from Unit 2A and effect thorough repair by 31 August and to bear all consequences arising from the water leakage ("Undertaking"). In her Defence, apart from denying liability for water seepage, the 1st defendant asserted that she signed the Undertaking under threat or undue influence.
7. Meanwhile, as the 1st defendant failed to effect payment of the remaining instalments of the Settlement Sum, the plaintiffs obtained a charging order nisi from this court which was registered against Unit 2A on 28 September 2011. It turned out the 1st defendant had contracted with the 2nd defendant for sale and purchase of Unit 2A on 12 September 2011 and completion took place on 31 October 2011 after the 1st defendant paid up the Settlement Sum for discharge of the said charging order nisi.
8. In September 2011, the plaintiffs complained again to the Joint Office. In December 2011, the plaintiffs filed a claim against both defendants with the Small Claims Tribunal which was subsequently transferred to this court, hence the present proceedings.
9. The test conducted in November 2011 having excluded the relevant drainage pipe as the source of leakage, the Joint Office commissioned a contractor to conduct a water dye test at Unit 2A on 25 February 2012. The contractor revisited the premises on 24 March 20121 and found the ceilings of Room 1C and Room 1D to be dry and saw no water dye. The Joint Office therefore took no further action.
10. On 19 December 2012, the parties' respective experts jointly inspected Unit 2A and noted that renovation works were being carried out. This led the plaintiffs to believe the defendants were tampering with the status quo of Unit 2A. At trial, upon clarification by the 2nd defendant that the renovation works had nothing to do with the bathroom of Unit 2A, this complaint was not pursued any further.
11. Between 1 and 7 February 2013, a ponding test (using fluorescent dye) and infrared scan tests were conducted at Unit 2A. A joint expert report was prepared recording the experts' disagreement as to whether Unit 2A was the source of the water seepage.
12. In July and October 2013, the plaintiffs' expert twice tested the moisture contents of the ceilings of Room 1D and Room 1C. A higher than normal level of moisture was recorded on the first occasion but not on the second occasion. The plaintiffs therefore accept that water seepage has stopped since October 2013.
13. The plaintiffs plead nuisance as a result of the water seepage without giving particulars, thereby causing the defendants to argue unnecessarily as to whether nuisance in the sense of interfering with one's comfortable and convenient enjoyment of his land could be caused to the plaintiffs who never were occupants of the premises in question. It is now clear that the plaintiffs are relying on nuisance merely as a basis for claiming damages for physical damage to their property and they are entitled so to do. See Lau Ting Hang & Another v Leung Chi Wing (DCCJ 6539/2005) 
unreported, 18 February 2008 at ยง30 and Clerk and Lindsell on Torts (20th ed) ยง20-06. To that extent, nuisance and negligence coincide and whether one's liability is described as falling one legal rubric or the other would seem to be only a difference of words. See Clerk and Lindsell on Torts (20th ed) ยง20-40.
14. The plaintiffs further plead a breach of s.34H of the Building Management Ordinance (Cap 344) on the defendants' part. The section imposes on an owner or occupant of any part of a building an obligation to all owners of the building to maintain the part in good repair and condition absent a similar obligation in the deed of mutual covenant. Miss Yung, counsel for the defendants, accepted that the defendants would be in breach of the section should water leakage be found to have come from Unit 2A.
15. The plaintiffs seek a mandatory injunction against the defendants requiring them to remove all the unauthorized structure erected on Unit 2A and a prohibitory injunction requiring the defendants to stop water leakage from Unit 2A permanently. They also claim damages for loss of rental income from and physical damage to Room 1C and Room 1D.
