Tort - negligence - nuisance - water seepage from premises to premises directly below - determination of source of water seepage 2. The following background facts are not in dispute.
3. The plaintiff is the registered owner of Flat A, 59/F., Tower 3, Harbourfront Landmark, No. 11 Wan Hoi Street, Kowloon ("59A") while the defendants those of the unit directly above ("60A").
4. Water seepage was first observed in the ceiling and partition walls of the master bathroom of 59A ("59A bathroom") in mid-2012 followed by the plaintiff's complaints to the defendants, the management office of Harbourfront Landmark ("management office") and the Joint Office of the Buildings Department and the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department ("Joint Office").
5. Initial inspection by the management office in July 2012 confirmed water seepage on the ceiling of the 59A bathroom and the defendants were informed of its suspicion that this had to do with the waterproofing layer (of the floor slab) of the master bathroom of 60A ("60A bathroom").
6. The color water test done by the Joint Office at the drainage pipes of 60A in September 2012 did not identify the source of leakage. In late December 2012, the professional consultant engaged by the Joint Office found leakage to 59A to have stopped.
7. In mid-2013, water leakage recurred in the 59A bathroom. This time water leakage was observed also in the master bedroom of 59A ("59A bedroom"). The plaintiff engaged its own expert to investigate the matter within the confine of 59A. The expert identified signs pointing to 60A as the source of leakage and the water sample collected indicated the leakage was related to the waste water pipe of a toilet. An inspection report was prepared and copied to the management office in early October 2013 ("2013 report").
8. Meanwhile, further complaints to and inspections by the management office and the Joint Office ensued. While water leakage was identified at 59A, further inspections and tests conducted by the Joint Office and its consultant after November 2013 failed to identify the source of leakage and the plaintiff was informed accordingly in June 2014.
9. In December 2013, the plaintiff commenced these proceedings pleading nuisance, negligence and breach of the relevant provisions of the Deed of Mutual Covenants on the part of the defendants and seeking damages for repairing the physical damage to 59A and an injunction to restrain the defendants or their servants or agents from repeating or continuing the water leakage as pleaded or any leakage of a similar kind.
10. On 13 September 2014, joint inspection and tests were conducted by the parties' respective experts pursuant to the court's direction and a joint expert report was prepared subsequently.
