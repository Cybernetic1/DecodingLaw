Tort - negligence - nuisance - water seepage from premises to premises immediately below - whether former premises source of seepage The plaintiffs’ case
 2. The 1st and 2nd plaintiffs are the registered owners of Flats C and D, 33rd Floor, Tower 9, Tierra Verde, Tsing Yi, New Territories, Hong Kong ("Ps' premises").
3. The 1st and 2nd defendants are the registered owners of Flat D, 35th Floor, Tower 9, Tierra Verde, Tsing Yi, New Territories, Hong Kong ("Ds' premises").
4. As with many housing estates built in the last decade or so, the description of the floor levels is somewhat misleading. Ds' premises are in fact immediately above Ps' premises insofar as Flat D is concerned.
5. On or about 15 July 2011, the plaintiffs found water was seeping from the floor slab of Ds' premises to the ceiling of the master bathroom of Ps' premises. By reason of the water seepage, the plaintiffs suspended the renovation that was undergoing at Ps' premises in order to avoid potential damage.
6. It is the plaintiffs' case that the seeping water came from Ds' premises.
7. The plaintiffs sought to establish liability against the defendants on the bases that the defendants were in breach of section E clause 7 of the Deed of Mutual Covenants; nuisance and negligence.
 The defendants’ case
 8. The defendants denied that Ds' premises were the source of the water seepage.
9. The defendants further said that the water came from the external wall of the building.
