Tort - nuisance - water seepage from premises to premises immediately below - whether current and/or former owners of former premises liable 1. The plaintiff is and was at all material times the owner of the property known as Flat A, 41st Floor, Tower 5, Dynasty Court, No 23 Old Peak Road, Hong Kong (" Flat 41A "). At all material times until 22 December 2008, the 2nd defendant was the owner of the unit immediately above Flat 41A (" Flat 42A ").
2. On 22 December 2008, the 1st defendant bought Flat 42A from the 2nd defendant and has since then become its owner.
3. The plaintiff claims that water seeped from Flat 42A into Flat 41A as early as in June 2008 when the 2nd defendant was the owner of Flat 42A, and the nuisance was continued by the 1st defendant when it became its owner, hence the present proceedings.
4. These proceedings concern three distinct complaints by the plaintiff:- 
 (1) alleged water seepage problem at the ceiling of the Master Bathroom of Flat 41A due to the defective water-proofing membrane of the floor slab at the corresponding part of Flat 42A. The plaintiff says seepage continued from June 2008 until December 2010 (" the MB floor slab problem ");
 (2) alleged water seepage problem at the ceiling of the Guest Bathroom of Flat 41A. The problem was discovered in early December 2008 and was soon rectified by the 2nd defendant's contractors on 13 December 2008 (" the GB problem "); and
 (3) another alleged water seepage problem in the Master Bathroom of Flat 41A due to defective basin pipes. It was discovered in or around August 2010, and it was rectified by December 2010 (" the MB pipes problem ").
 
5. In its Written Opening dated 11 March 2013, the 1st defendant outlined its defence to the plaintiff's claim as follows:- 
 (1) insofar as the plaintiff seeks to rely on the expert reports, the 1st defendant (and its expert) will say that the methodology adopted by the plaintiff's expert is unreliable and cannot prove that water seeped from Flat 42A into Flat 41A;
 (2) further or alternatively, certain seepage problems existed before the 1st defendant became the owner of Flat 42A;
 (3) if reliance is placed on the defective drainage pipes, those were duly repaired in a reasonable time by the 1st defendant and no liability can attach; and
 (4) the Settlement Agreements operate to prevent the plaintiff from bringing new claims against the 1st defendant/2nd defendant on matters that were settled.
 
6. Over the course of the trial, this court received evidence from 4 factual witnesses and 2 expert witnesses.
7. Mr Koo Yuk Chan (" Mr Koo ") was the plaintiff's main and only factual witness. Mr K S Wong (" P's Expert ") was the plaintiff's expert witness. Madam Ye Jia Li (" Madam Ye ") was the 1st defendant's first witness. She is the current tenant of Flat 42A. Mr Yip Wing Kui (" Mr Yip ") was the 1st defendant's main factual witness. Mr John Yip (" D1's Expert ") was the 1st defendant's expert witness. Madam Ko Ling Yi (" Madam Ko ") was the 2nd defendant's sole witness.
8. Aside from defending the plaintiff's claim, the 1st defendant has brought contribution proceedings against the 2nd defendant, such that if the 1st defendant is liable to the plaintiff, the 1st defendant seeks contribution from the 2nd defendant over such liability.
