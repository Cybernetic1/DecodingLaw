34. The principles relating to Order 14 applications are well-established. Suffice it to say that the defendants bear the burden to show a reasonable defence and that the court should refrain from conducting a trial on affidavit evidence. The question to be asked is whether the defendants' evidence is believable rather than whether it is to be believed. 42. Miss Lau urges me to consider Cheung's allegation that CFY and his workers placed the building materials and equipment on the Land and his assertion that such building materials and equipment were destroyed by the defendants. Cheung says according to CFY the value of the damaged properties amounts to HK$50,000 to HK$60,000. She submits that putting two and two together the said defendants must have entered the Land unlawfully and damaged the said properties of CFY.
43. I am unable to agree to this submission. There is no evidence of the said defendants' destroying the said properties of CFY on the Land at all. There is no evidence as to who witnessed the alleged criminal damage of the said defendants and no particulars is given as to how and where the said defendants destroyed the said properties. In any event, the said defendants deny this grave allegation and they must have their day in court to show their innocence. I also cannot allow any claim for damages arising from the alleged damage caused to the said properties at this stage.
