55. Indeed, as pointed out by Mr Lo in his closing submission, pursuant to Clause 3(B)(e) of the DMC, the 1st defendant was imposed upon a responsibility for the repair and maintenance of such part of the flat roof of which he had exclusive right to use, occupy and enjoy. 56. I also note that in the same provision of the DMC, any owners of the Building or the manager or his agents shall have the right to remain on such part of the flat roof as may be necessary for the purpose of inspecting certain structures and facilities for common purposes (water pipes, electricity wires, ducts or sewers) and carrying out any maintenance or repair to the same. Such common structures and facilities do not include the floor of the flat roof. I am therefore fortified in my view that the floor of the flat roof (meaning the top layer of the floor slab) is not common part.
57. I find that the 1st defendant was in breach of his duty under Clause 3(B)(e) of the DMC in that he failed to effect proper repair and maintenance of the floor of the 1st defendant's Property, in particular, the flat roof. In the premises, the 1st defendant should be liable for the damage caused by the defective floor slab of the flat roof of the 1st defendant to the plaintiffs' Property, which according to Dr Paul Wong, was the source of water seepage.
58. I also find that the 1st defendant was in breach of Clause 10(c) of the DMC in that the 1st defendant failed in his duty not to create any nuisance. I further find that the plaintiffs' nuisance claim is proved by the evidence.
59. In conclusion, the plaintiffs succeed in their claim.
