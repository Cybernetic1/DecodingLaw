70. To conclude, I find the plaintiff has successfully established causation of the seepage for the 1st period but not the 2nd to 4th periods. I come to the view that the plaintiff has failed to discharge the burden of proof placed upon her to show that the water seepage during the 2nd to 4th periods had originated from the defendants' premises.
71. The next matter I need to consider is whether there was any breach of the DMC or tort of nuisance for the water seepage caused during the 1st period.
