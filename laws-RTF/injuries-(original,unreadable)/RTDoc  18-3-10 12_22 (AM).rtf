He came to Hong Kong as an asylum seeker in 2009. On 21 September 2013, he sustained personal injuries while working for the defendant, Mr Li. Mr Arslan thereby brought proceedings under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance in DCEC 1965 of 2014 ("EC Case") and these proceedings to claim damages. He is now 27 years old, and speaks Punjabi, Urdu, some English and some Chinese.\par}

Counsel for Mr Arslan, Mr Carl Yuen, informed this court that a notice of hearing had been duly served at the office of a business owned by Mr Li. Since solicitors for Mr Arslan gave an undertaking to file an affirmation of service within 3 days, trial of this action continued in the absence of Mr Li.\par}

According to these statements, Mr Arslan became acquainted with Mr Li in 2011 when Mr Arslan was a tenant of Mr Li at some premises in Kam Tin. On 21 September 2013, Mr Arslan was brought to the place of accident, which was at 1145 Ha Che Tsuen, Pat Heung, New Territories ("Site"), to take down a wall of a house. The wall was made of mud and brick, and was measured about 9 feet in length by 10 feet in height.\par}

At trial, Mr Arslan confirmed that no other instruction, tool or equipment such as gloves, helmet or safety shoe was given by Mr Li, who left the Site about 15 to 20 minutes afterwards. As Mr Arslan hammered the wall in the way he was told, the wall collapsed on him which led to his personal injuries. He was alone at the material time.\par}

Mr Arslan attended the Site for the first time on 20 September 2013 to remove the roof of the house. The date of the accident was hence the second day of his employment. As Mr Arslan understood, Mr Li intended to build a new house. Mr Arslan also said at trial that to gain access to the Site, Mr Li and he needed to go through a main gate opened by Mr Li.\par}

Essentially, he denied having employed Mr Arslan who was no more than a tenant to him. No other useful particular was provided by Mr Li. He did not file a list of documents nor did he produce any other document in these proceedings.\par}

Mr Li attended trial on 30 August 2016. Having heard evidence from parties, the court in the EC Case considered it inexplicable for Mr Arslan to be able to identify the Site and also the private car in which he was brought by Mr Li to the Site had Mr Arslan been just a tenant. The court in the EC Case was further left with an impression that Mr Li intentionally hid the fact that he ran a business which involved the hiring of general labours at the at material time.\par}

As matter stood, Mr Li did not appear to have brought an appeal against the earlier decision.\par}

I further find that Mr Li was an occupier of the Site at the material time.\par}

Save the simplest, but apparently inappropriate, instructions to demolish the wall Mr Arslan was left alone at the Site with only a hammer to find out by himself how to execute those instructions. I have no hesitation to find that Mr Li was in breach of the implied terms under the employment contract as well as the statutory duties as an employer under the Occupational Safety and Health Ordinance, Cap 509 to provide a safe system of work, necessary supervision and a safe place of work. Mr Li must also be in further breach of the common duty of care as an occupier under the Occupiers Liability Ordinance, Cap 314.\par}

He was then transferred to the Tuen Mun Hospital on the same day to be diagnosed of a closed fracture of the left acetabulum, a fracture of the lumbar spine at the L2/L3 level, a dislocation at the L5/S1 level, and a fracture of proximal phalanx of the left ring finger.\par}

The fracture at his pelvis was treated by way of closed reduction with internal fixation. Mr Arslan was discharged from hospital on 3 October 2013 whereafter he received physiotherapy and occupational therapy. As back pain persisted, Mr Arslan was readmitted to the Tuen Mun Hospital to receive an injection. In October 2014, the metal implant at the spine was removed. Sick leave was given to Mr Arslan intermittently which ended on 17 February 2015. On 2 March 2015, the Medical Assessment Board assessed a loss of earning capacity of 14% which was reviewed to 17% on 6 July 2015.\par}

In the report of Dr Lau dated 2 March 2016, it was recorded that Mr Arslan complained of multiple scars over his right face and both elbows. In addition to some darkish discolouration around both eyes, Mr Arslan also complained of right sided headache once a week which lasted for an hour or so each time, pain in the left finger when holding heavy objects or wringing a towel, continuous low back pain which intensified to grade 8-9/10 when sitting from more than half an hour or lying in bed for long periods, disturbed sleeps 3 nights a weeks, intermittent pain in the left hip at grade 7-8/10 particularly during cold and humid weather, walking for over 10 minutes or climbing stairs, and the inability to squat.\par}

However, Mr Arslan was unable to make a full squat, or to walk on tiptoes or heels. Mr. Arslan was also unable to stand on his left leg. As for his back, Dr Lau did not find any swelling or deformity but there was a 23 cm long scar extending from L1 to S2 level of the spine with tenderness at the surrounding areas. As for the hip, Dr Lau also did not find any swelling or deformity. There was a 1 cm scar to the left of the scrotum similarly with tenderness at the nearby region.\par}

Straight leg raising while sitting was 90 degrees on the right side but 70 degrees on the left side. There was also a decreased range of movement of the hip on the left with slight muscle wasting of the thigh and calf. As for the ring finger, Dr Lau observed that there was mild bony swelling and tenderness over the dorsum of the proximal phalanx, however, the range of movement was found to be normal.\par}

Despite signs of exaggeration in the symptoms discovered over the examination, Dr Lau considered that Mr Arslan would continue to experience significant residual left hip pain in the future, and some degree of residual pain, stiffens and weakness in the back. Accordingly, Dr Lau concluded that Mr Arslan was unable to resume pre-accident occupation as a construction worker and recommended that he took lighter duties such as restroom attendant, fuel station worker, cashier or office light cleansing worker. Dr Lau assessed the permanent impairment to the whole person at 16%, and a loss of earning capacity at 20%. Dr Lau also considered a sick leave period of 12 to 16 months to be appropriate.\par}

Mr Arslan was an asylum seeker who was required to enter a recognizance under s 36 of the Immigration Ordinance, Cap 115. On his own evidence, he needed to obtain approval from the Director of the Immigration in order to work locally.

For as long as Mr Arslan remains in Hong Kong as an asylum seeker, he cannot be lawfully employed. Mr Arslan did not give evidence, and likewise neither evidence was led from him by Mr Yuen at trial, as to how long Mr Arslan's claim for protection would take or as to any employment prospects had Mr Arslan, for instance, elected to return to his home country. It is clear from Dr Lau that Mr Arslan is able to return to a number of types of work. Over the rather short 2 hour trial, Mr Arslan also appeared to have acted normally without any sign of walking disability or apparent discomfort in court. There is no evidence whatsoever that Mr Arslan will face a substantial or real risk of a disadvantage in getting the recommended employments or the level of monthly income Mr Arslan might receive from a lawful employment had he not sustained the injuries. As matter stands, there is no evidence that Mr Arslan will start lawful employment at all for as long as his asylum seeker status remains.\par}

At trial, Mr Arslan explained that he attended follow up treatments by taxi for about 5 return trips at $100.00 each trip, and by bus for another 10 return trips at $15.00 each trip. He also said that he had purchased painkillers for about 40 times each time spending about $30.00 to $40.00.\par}

Mr Yuen agreed that credit is to be given to Mr Li in Mr Arslan's claim in these proceedings.\par}

In the Revised Statement of Damages, Mr Arslan claimed a total sum of $999,548.00, out of which $270,428.00 was for loss of pre-trial earnings and MPF, $204,120.00 was for loss of future earnings and future MPF, and $30,000.00 was for loss of earning capacity.\par}

The claim for future loss of earnings was only abandoned when counsel opened his case. In my view, the pursuance of these claims was simply ill advised. Applying a broad brush principle, I deny one third of the plaintiff's costs in these proceedings. I make a costs order nisi, to be made absolute within 14 days from this judgment, for the defendant to pay two thirds of the plaintiff's costs in this action, to be taxed if not agreed. The plaintiff's own costs shall be taxed in accordance with the Legal Aid Regulations.\par}
