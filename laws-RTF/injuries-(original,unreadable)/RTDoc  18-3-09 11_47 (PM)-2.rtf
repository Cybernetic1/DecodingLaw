It is thus common ground that once the causation issue is determined in the PI Proceedings, the issue on liability in respect of the EC Proceedings will be completely disposed of.\par}

The Employer hence took a procedural step in the PI Proceedings by issuing an interlocutory application on 11 July 2017 for an order for a split trial, which application I was informed would be heard on {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul 27 March 2018}.\par}

If the Applicant/Plaintiff is successful on the liability issue she can apply for an interim payment immediately.

Indeed, the Stay Summons already has brought about some delay before its disposal as the entire proceedings have come to a grinding halt since the issuance of the Stay Summons in June 2017. The prejudice brought about by the delay is the main ground of objection. In the next friend's affirmation in opposition, she deposed that a further delay of the EC Proceedings would result in severe financial hardship to the applicant and his family that consist of the next friend and their two children in full-time education.\par}

As Miss Lee in her submissions referred to the obtaining of "various expert reports" (see para 22 above), it appears to me that the procedural steps on quantum in the PI Proceedings are not yet complete.\par}

Since no other expert reports will be needed for the EC Proceedings, Miss Lee's reference to "various expert reports" would seem to suggest that more expert reports will be needed for the quantum issue in the PI Proceedings.\par}

The uncertainty of an early determination of the liability issue of the PI Proceedings will, in my judgment, greatly reduce the attractiveness of the proposed course Miss Lee has compellingly put forth.\par}

After reviewing the evidence of the EC Proceedings at the hearing, I have found that the EC Proceedings were in fact ready for trial notwithstanding that progress had been stalled due to the stay application.\par}

\qj \hyphpar0 \cbpat0 {\sa60\sb60\li0\ri0\fi0\sl288\slmult1 \f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 35.} By the time of the hearing of the Stay Summons, apart from the only outstanding issue of the exchange of witness statements (the subject matter of the Unless Order Summons), all the procedural steps had been completed in the EC Proceedings.\par}

\qj \hyphpar0 \cbpat0 {\sa60\sb60\li0\ri0\fi0\sl288\slmult1 \f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 36.} The whole matter regarding the exchange of witness statements has become moot (as the parties also acknowledged at the hearing). Since the parties were in agreement that both Proceedings have identical factual witnesses (and also neurological expert witnesses), the same witness statements that were already exchanged in the PI Proceedings could be relied on and adduced in the EC Proceedings. Hence, once the court could give a direction for the use of the same witness statements exchanged in the PI Proceedings, the parties were already ready for trial.\par}

\qj \hyphpar0 \cbpat0 {\sa60\sb60\li0\ri0\fi0\sl288\slmult1 \f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 37.} I have indeed found that the EC Proceedings could be fixed for trial. At the trial, the main dispute would be on causation. As for quantum, I believe that it was quite straightforward in light of the agreement of the experts that the applicant suffered 100 percent loss of earning capacity.\par}

\qj \hyphpar0 \cbpat0 {\sa60\sb60\li0\ri0\fi0\sl288\slmult1 \f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 38.} Thus, the estimated length of trial for liability and quantum for the EC Proceedings should be the same as that estimated for the liability trial of the PI Proceedings of 5 days.\par}

\qj \hyphpar0 \cbpat0 {\sa60\sb60\li0\ri0\fi0\sl288\slmult1 \f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 39.} Once this court was able to find a timeslot of 5 days in May for the trial, I consider that it is imperative that the statutory objective in allowing the EC Proceedings to be disposed of "speedily and with considerable certainty" ({\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i \strike0 \ul0 LKK}, {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i \strike0 \ul0 supra.}, para 15 above) should be observed.\par}

However, the resolution of the liability issue in the EC Proceedings, irrespective of the outcome, would also save further costs being incurred in the PI Proceedings. By the operation of the doctrine of issue estoppel, the determination of the issues on liability in the EC Proceedings (subject of course to any further appeal) would also conclude the overlapping issue on causation for both Proceedings, which is whether the applicant's Injury was caused by an accident arising out of and in the course of employment. Whilst it is not completely true that the PI Proceedings stand and fall with the outcome of the EC Proceedings, the PI Proceedings do "fall" with the EC Proceedings as a dismissal of the latter will put an end to the PI Proceedings. It was only when the applicant succeeds in the EC Proceedings that the additional issue of negligence would need to be further litigated later in the High Court.\par}

\qj \hyphpar0 \cbpat0 {\sa60\sb60\li0\ri0\fi0\sl288\slmult1 \f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 41.} In refusing the stay, I have borne in mind the guidance given by Bharwaney J in {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i \strike0 \ul0 Maxwell} that the disposal of the PI Proceedings would avoid the need for a further contested application in the EC Proceedings. In the present case, as the facts discussed above clearly show, this court was faced with a situation between the uncertainty of an early trial on liability for the PI Proceedings and the certainty of an early trial for the EC Proceedings. Weight therefore must be given to the proceedings that were ready for trial. By allowing the EC Proceedings to proceed to trial not only fulfilled the statutory legislative objective, but also furthers the underlying objectives stated in para 18 above.\par}

\qj \hyphpar0 \cbpat0 {\sa60\sb60\li0\ri0\fi0\sl288\slmult1 \f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 42.} Any unexpected events in the development of the PI Proceedings such as an early trial on liability may call for the need to revisit the directions that I have given. Hence, I consider that it would be prudent for this court to grant the parties the liberty to apply to vacate the trial of the EC Proceedings to cater for such eventuality. A notional early trial date needed to be decided upon. I believe that 6 months from the hearing of the application for a split trial should be reasonable. Hence, 30 September 2018 was set as the notional trial date. \par}

By the usual rule of "costs following the event", the Employer should be required to pay for the costs of the application.\par}

\qj \hyphpar0 \cbpat0 {\sa60\sb60\li0\ri0\fi0\sl288\slmult1 \f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 44.} Miss Lee however argued that neither party was successful in the stay application. It was contented that the Employer has not entirely lost as this court has left an opening for a stay by granting liberty to the parties to apply for the vacation of the trial and stay of the EC Proceedings in the event that the PI Proceedings on liability could be heard on or before 30 September 2018.\par}

\qj \hyphpar0 \cbpat0 {\sa60\sb60\li0\ri0\fi0\sl288\slmult1 \f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 45.} Mr Szeto disagreed that there was no losing party. Simply because the court might later grant a stay of the EC Proceedings in the event of a certain event happening, Mr Szeto submitted, did not mean that the Employer was not a clear loser.\par}

\qj \hyphpar0 \cbpat0 {\sa60\sb60\li0\ri0\fi0\sl288\slmult1 \f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 46.} I am in respectful agreement with Mr Szeto. It is a strained argument that the Employer has not lost when its Stay Summons is dismissed. The opening to the Employer to apply for a stay in the event of an early trial in the High Court does not mean that the Stay Summons is still at large. It will be a matter for future adjudication. I consider that the applicant has wholly succeeded in opposing the stay application, which is clearly evidenced by the fact that the EC Proceedings are now fixed for trial.\par}

These costs are to be taxed if not agreed. The applicant's own costs are to be taxed in accordance with the Legal Aid Regulations.\par}

\qj \hyphpar0 \cbpat0 {\sa60\sb60\li0\ri0\fi0\sl288\slmult1 \f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 49.} It was however contended by Miss Lee that, in light of the court in finding it unnecessary to grant any order, the Unless Order Summons was merely a technical application as the applicant in fact was already in possession of the witness statements having been exchanged in the PI Proceedings.\par}

\qj \hyphpar0 \cbpat0 {\sa60\sb60\li0\ri0\fi0\sl288\slmult1 \f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 50.} I do not consider the Unless Order Summons was a technical application as Miss Lee alleged. As a matter of fact, the applicant did not have the witness statements exchanged in the PI Proceedings when the summons was issued in June 2017 as they were only exchanged on 7 August 2017 in the PI Proceedings. After the perusal of the court order concerning the exchange of the witness statements in the EC Proceedings as well as the correspondence from the applicant's solicitors informing this court of the Employer's failure in complying with the order for exchange, I am of the view that the Employer did not comply with the timetable for the exchange. According to the applicant's solicitors, they wrote to the court for directions because the Employer did not respond to the latter's proposal to extend the deadline date for the exchange to 23 June 2017.\par}

\qj \hyphpar0 \cbpat0 {\sa60\sb60\li0\ri0\fi0\sl288\slmult1 \f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 51.} In face of the Employer's silence, I consider that the applicant was wholly justified in issuing the Unless Order Summons and is entitled to the costs of issuing the summons.\par}

\qj \hyphpar0 \cbpat0 {\sa60\sb60\li0\ri0\fi0\sl288\slmult1 \f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 52.} Nonetheless, once the witness statements in the PI Proceedings were exchanged on 7 August 2017, an order compelling the Employer to exchange witness statements would have seemed to be, as Miss Lee suggested, academic. Shortly after these witness statements were exchanged, it would have been apparent to the solicitors acting for the parties that the issue of the exchange had fallen by the wayside as the witnesses were (as the parties acknowledged) identical. The solicitors (perhaps, with hindsight) should have asked for the court's direction, in light of the identical witnesses to be called for both proceedings, for the dispensation of the exchange, and to vacate the hearing.\par}

\qj \hyphpar0 \cbpat0 {\sa60\sb60\li0\ri0\fi0\sl288\slmult1 \f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 53.} In the circumstances, a different costs order should be made to reflect what is stated above. As both parties seem to have been equally at fault, I consider that a fair order is to order each party to bear their own costs after the parties had been given a reasonable time after 7 August 2017 to consider the contents of the statements. I consider two weeks, which is until 21 August 2017, to be a reasonable time. Thus, after 21 August 2017, there be an order of no order as to costs.\par}
