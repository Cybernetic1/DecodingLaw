In the evening of 1 March 2012, the plaintiff was working at the restaurant. Her duties included collecting cooked food from the kitchen and passing it to her colleagues in the dining area who were waiting at tables. Her work necessitated her walking in and out of the kitchen. Access to the kitchen was to be had through a passageway at the back of the dining area. A water-absorbent non-slip mat measuring approximately 3.5m x 1.1m ("the Mat") was placed outside the Kitchen. At around 9:30 pm, the plaintiff was told to go to the kitchen to pick up two bowls of rice. As she was walking out of the kitchen with two bowls of rice on a tray, she fell while walking on the Mat.\par}

Per her, she started her shift at around 6 pm, some three and a half hours before the accident. During the three and a half hours, she walked in and out of the kitchen many times. However, she did not complain about the Mat being wet and slippery before the happening of the accident. As to why she said in the pleadings that the Mat was wet and slippery, she answered:-

Yet, it appears to me that the plaintiff has fallen into a trap that people may occasionally fall into, to is to say, when one loses his balance, he may tend to assume that there must be something wrong with the surface he walks on and start to look for a loose brick. This common human reaction is sometimes seen in a tennis game: when a player fails to return a serve, he may tend to look at his racket and search for a flaw in it.\par}

My impression is reinforced by the following question and answer in the plaintiff's cross-examination (when she was cross-examined as to how she managed to see water on a dark-coloured water absorbent mat): -

A notion that is bad in law.\par}

"). The use of the words "slipped or stumbled" further reinforces my impression that the plaintiff was not certain as to whether she slipped or stumbled on the Mat. Slipping and stumbling, both capable of resulting in a fall though, are two different causes. Given that it is not the case of the plaintiff that she slipped and was tripped up by the Mat at the same time, the use of the words " \u34987\?\u22320\?\u27631\?\u28369\?\u20498\?/\u32070\?\u20498\? " suggests that she did not actually know what caused her to fall.\par}

Despite the most industrious and admirable efforts of Ms Lau, the plaintiff was unable to give a more concrete reason for her fall.\par}

\qj \hyphpar0 \cbpat0 {\sa60\sb60\li0\ri0\fi0\sl288\slmult1 \f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 15.} On the cause of the fall, it is my view that the plaintiff was unaware of any unusual event that caused her to fall. Having taken such view, I am unable to accept her evidence that the Mat was wet and slippery. For if she actually knew that the Mat was wet and slippery, she would not have to raise the possibility that she might have been tripped by the Mat.\par}

\qj \hyphpar0 \cbpat0 {\sa60\sb60\li0\ri0\fi0\sl288\slmult1 \f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 16.} On the issue whether the Mat was wet and slippery, it is the evidence of the plaintiff that she could feel wetness in the Mat when she touched it. However, the fact that the Mat might be a little wet does not necessarily mean that it was slippery. After all, the Mat was a water absorbent mat designed to absorb water. In any event, I prefer the evidence of Madam Wong of the defendant to that of the plaintiff. Madam Wong, who has left the defendant's employment for quite some time, was at the time of the accident the supervisor of a team of pantry helpers. Her evidence is that the Mat was provided by a cleaning sub-contractor engaged by the defendant, which would attend the restaurant on a regular basis to replace a used mat with a new or washed one. For her team members' and her own safety, she always paid attention to the condition of the Mat. If she or her team members came to notice that the Mat was wet and slippery, she would ask one of the cleaners to clean the Mat. She had walked on Mat dozens of times before and after the accident but did not notice any water or find it slippery.\par}

There was also some overreaction on her part when she was crtiticised for choosing not to offer a helping hand to the plaintiff after the accident. However, her general attitude does not affect the quality of her evidence. She remained unshaken under skillful cross-examination and adamant that the Mat was not wet and slippery. Ms Lau has tried to undermine Madam Wong's evidence by suggesting that Madam Wong, who was unable to identify the exact spots that she walked on, might have walked on the dry parts of the Mat while the plaintiff was unlucky enough to have walked on the wet and slippery parts. I find Ms Lau's argument too artificial as no one will bother take a note of where exactly his foot land when walking. Given that Madam Wong had walked in and out of the kitchen dozens of times before and after the accident, chances are that Ms Wong and her team members would have noticed any water or other slippery substance on the Mat, if there were any. I find Madam Wong a candid and forthcoming witness and accept her evidence that the Mat was not wet and slippery.\par}

It is correct that there are discrepancies in the plaintiff's evidence. However, given her background and level of education, the discrepancies are not unexpected. Testifying in court can be a frightening experience to a lay person. Bearing in mind the following observation of Suffiad J in

, notwithstanding my finding that the plaintiff did not know what caused her to fall, I do not accept the defendant's counsel's submission that the plaintiff is such an untruthful witness that the court should completely disregard her evidence: -

A new or washed one would also be provided on demand if the old one became too dirty or broken. There was also routine and on a needs basis cleaning of the floor and the Mat by the defendant's staff.\par}

On the other hand, the defendant contends that the plaintiff worked some three days a week. At her daily rate of $180, the plaintiff was earning $2,457 a month.\par}

I accept the plaintiff's evidence that she was earning $5,400 a month.\par}
