1. The defendant has been charged with two offences, causing death by dangerous driving, contrary to Section 36(1) of the Road Traffic Ordinance, Cap 374; and using a motor vehicle with an illegal display unit contrary to Regulations 37 and 121(1) of the Road Traffic (Construction and Maintenance of Vehicle) Regulations made under the Road Traffic Ordinance, Cap 374. 96. I repeat the two limb definition of driving dangerously pursuant to Section 36(4) of Cap 374.
97. A person is to be regarded as driving dangerously within the meaning of Section 36(4)(1) if the way he drives falls far below what would be expected of a competent and careful driver, and it would be obvious to a competent and careful driver that driving in that way would be dangerous.
