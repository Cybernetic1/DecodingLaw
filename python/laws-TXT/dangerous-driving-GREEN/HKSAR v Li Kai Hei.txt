32. Defendant is now aged 68. He has no criminal convictions but he has two previous careless-driving records and also a fixed penalty for speeding. But it is fair to say that for a driver who has held his driving licence for many years, that record cannot be said to be very bad. Of course, it is not a good one either.
33. For Defendant's age and his not-too-bad record, I shall give him a total discount of 3 months, and that is all I can give him. Thus, on Charge 1, I sentence Defendant to 21 months' imprisonment after trial.
34. On Charge 1, Defendant is also to be disqualified from driving all vehicles for 5 years or until he has completed a driving improvement course at his own cost, whichever is the later. The disqualification order is to take effect from today.
35. Defendant has to attend and complete the driving improvement course within the last three months of the disqualification period.
