Breach of DMC
 93. Clause 10 of the DMC states as follows:- "Each of the parties heretothe floor of which he is entitled to the exclusive use, occupation and enjoyment or any part thereof  shall not do or suffer or permit to be done anything therein or thereupon which may be or become a nuisance,  annoyance or inconvenience to the occupiers of the other parts of (the Building) or of the premises in the neighbourhood."

 94. Based on my above findings, I find D in breach of Clause 10 of the DMC and liable to P as sued.
 Breach of duty under the tort of nuisance/negligence
 95. In order to establish a breach of duty under the tort of nuisance, P must establish that D had: 
 (1) Actual or constructive knowledge of the origin of the seepage; and
 (2) Failed to take remedial steps within reasonable time: See eg Tong Chi Ying & another v Shum Ping Kuen Benson & another, unreported, DCCJ 3566/2004 (DDJ R Yu; 24 September 2010); Tin Kin Ka Clara v Chan Koon Cheong & Anor, unreported, DCCJ 3139/2012 (HHJ Andrew Li; 11 May 2015)
 
96. On the evidence, I find on a balance of probabilities that D had known or ought to have known the origin of the water seepage, ie from the 8/F Flat, in the Damaged Room. This is consistent with its agreement to pay the repair cost back in 2012, and as pleaded herein. The water seepage problems had persisted over a long period of more than 5 years. D is shown to have failed to take remedial steps within reasonable time.
97. I find D liable for breach of duty under the tort of nuisance. 98. On that basis, D should also be held liable for breach of its duty owed to its neighbour P. It was reasonably foreseeable that P would suffer loss and damage as a result of its omission to take remedial steps to rectify the water seepage problems in the Damaged Room. I find D liable in negligence as sued.
