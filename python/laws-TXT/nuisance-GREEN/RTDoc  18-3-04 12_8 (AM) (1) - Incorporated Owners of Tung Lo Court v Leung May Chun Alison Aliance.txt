(A) Damages for breach of the DMC
 198. For Madam Leung's counterclaim for breach of the DMC, it is a breach of contract claim. 210. The measures for breach of DMC and private nuisance for interfering with Madam Leung's interests to the Car Parks for the period from 15 March 2011 to 22 January 2013 are the same. The question to be asked is what would be the position of Madam Leung if the smart cards for the Car Parks had been issued to her on 15 March 2011?
211. In this case, there is a conspicuous lack of actual evidence on damages alleged to have been sustained by Madam Leung. In the absence of evidence establishing the quantum of damages, the appropriate award is one of nominal damages. (See Born Chief Co v George Tsai & Another [1996] 2 HKLR 188 
) I find that Madam Leung has also failed to prove quantum of her loss for the period from 15 March 2011 to 22 January 2013. She is again only entitled to nominal damages for this period for her private nuisance claim. 212. I order that the IO do pay $10 as nominal damages to Madam Leung for its wrongful closure of the Basement and do pay another $10 as nominal damages to Madam Leung for its wrongful refusal to issue smart cards for the Car Parks to Madam Leung prior to 23 January 2013. 213. Although Madam Leung failed to prove that she had suffered actual loss due to the wrongful acts of the IO in infringing her property right and under the DMC and only nominal damages are awarded to her, she has nevertheless succeeded in these parts of her counterclaim. It is noted that when Madam Leung lodged her counterclaim on 19 December 2011, the IO was still in breach of the DMC and was still infringing her property right. It was only until 23 January 2013, ie 4 weeks before the trial, that the IO had agreed to issue the smart cards for the Car Parks to her.
