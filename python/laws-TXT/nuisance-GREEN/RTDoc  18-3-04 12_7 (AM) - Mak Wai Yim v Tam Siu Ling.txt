57. On balance, I am inclined to accept the evidence of Mr. Wong and Mr. Li that yellow-greenish colour appeared on the ceiling of Room 1D 48 hours after the ponding test which was still observable on 7 February 2013, which proves Unit 2A to be the source of the water seepage to Room 1D.
58. This conclusion is not affected by the lack of a laboratory test to verify what appeared on the ceiling of Room 1D to be the fluorescent dye. The FEHD Guideline specifically provides that "the appearance of specific colour dye shall deem to be a positive result indicating the source of seepage". Before the ponding test, Mr. Wong and Mr. Fung had ensured there was no pre-existing colour on the ceiling of Room 1D that might affect the result of the ponding test. One can therefore safely apply the "deeming" provision in the FEHD Guideline and assume what appeared in Room 1D was the fluorescent dye used in the ponding test. 71. I order that the defendants do pay the plaintiffs damages in the total sum of $83,000 ($10,800 + $72,200) with interest at half judgment rate from 18 April 2012 until judgment and thereafter at judgment rate until payment.
