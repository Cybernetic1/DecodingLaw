36. I reject the opinion of the plaintiff's expert that water had seeped from Flat 8B to Flat 7B. For the reasons stated above, his conclusion is not properly substantiated by evidence.
37. I accept the opinion of the defendants' expert that the water probably came from the external wall of the Building and seeped into Flat 7B. His opinion is supported by the fact that seepage was observed at the ceiling during the 2nd Inspection (in the course of the water spray test) and the 6th Inspection (after days of rainfall).
