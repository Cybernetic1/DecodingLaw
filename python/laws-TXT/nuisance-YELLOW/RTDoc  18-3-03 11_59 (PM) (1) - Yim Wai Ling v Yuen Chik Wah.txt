 1. The plaintiffs, being mother and son, are the registered owner of the premises known as Flat 9, 11th Floor, Block A, Kam On Court, No. 20 Hang Kam Street, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong ("P's Premises") whilst the defendants are the registered owner of the premises immediately above P's Premises ("D's Premises"). The layout of P's Premises and D's Premises are exactly the same and there is only 1 toilet inside the premises.
2. Upon purchase of P's Premises in 1997, the 2nd Plaintiff ("P2") and his sister Madam Poon ("Poon") used it as their residence and P2 moved out from P's Premises in December 2010 leaving Poon as the only occupier at P's Premises since then.
3. On 21 January 2010, water seepage was found at the ceiling inside the toilet of P's Premises. The management company of the Kam On Court was informed on 21 January 2010 and complaint was made to the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department ("FEHD") on 23 January 2010 as well (B/104). Investigation was being conducted by the FEHD including a water test inside the toilet of D's Premises in March 2010 (B/126).
4. On 14 April 2010, Poon received a letter from FEHD (B/102) confirming that the water seepage at P's Premises came from the floor slab, the bath tub and the walls inside the toilet of D's Premises (  『上層單位浴室的地台、浴缸及周邊牆壁引致貴單位滲水情況』  ). And the FEHD had given notice requiring the defendants to repair and remedy the water seepage problem within stipulated time. According to a visit by the FEHD to D's Premises on 7 May 2010, it is confirmed that the defendants did take remedial steps by laying water proof material underneath the whole bathtub (  『已用防水物料鋪蓋了整個浴缸底』  ). On 14 May 2010, the FEHD visited P's Premises and found the water seepage had stopped. These are recorded in a letter from FEHD to the plaintiffs dated 18 May 2010 (Exh D1). This is referred to as the 2010 Incident in this judgment.
5. On 9 June 2010, the plaintiffs issued legal proceedings against the defendants for damages arising from the 2010 Incident at the Small Claims Tribunal ("SCTC Claim") (B/108-109). In the claim form, a quotation prepared by a company called Kai Kei Engineering ("Kai Kei") for the repair works in the sum of $11,900 was attached (B/112). The SCTC Claim was settled on 7 July 2010 in the sum of $11,000.
6. In November 2010, the plaintiffs had engaged Vic's Decoration Co. ("Vic's") to renovate the whole unit of P's Premises including the toilet (B/248-251).
7. On 11 November 2012, Poon discovered large amount of pink coloured water dripping from the false ceiling inside the toilet of P's Premises at 3am. Complaint was made to the management company and upon inspection by the management staff on 12 November 2012, water was found seeping from the ceiling inside the toilet of P's Premises and there was water trapped underneath the bathtub inside the toilet of D's Premises (B/114). Photos were being taken by staff of the management company (B/115-118). The defendants then started replacing the fresh water pipes underneath the bathtub and completed on 26 November 2012.
8. Poon had also lodged a complaint with the FEHD on 12 November 2012 and staff from the FEHD had collected samples of the pink water from P's Premises for analysis and on 10 December 2012, the FEHD confirmed in a telephone conversation with Poon that the water sample contained the colouring used in the water test conducted by FEHD at D's Premises for the 2010 Incident (B/127).
9. On 13 December 2012, the management staff visited P's Premises upon complaint by Poon again and discovered that the water seepage on the ceiling inside the toilet at P's Premises still persisted. Photographs were being taken by the management staff at both P's Premises and D's Premises (B/119-120). A letter was sent to the defendants by the management office to remind them of the duty to repair and follow up (B/114). On 16 and 17 December 2012, the defendants replaced a section of the drainage conduit which ran in the vicinity of the bottom of the bathtub.
10. On 18 December 2012, staff of the FEHD inspected P's Premises again and conducted a test with instruments and confirmed one or two patches on the ceiling were still wet. Poon then engaged Mr Wong Shun Tai Stewart ("Wong") of Proficient Surveyors & Co to find out the source of the water seepage.
11. Wong attended P's Premises on 18 December 2012 and had also gained entry to D's Premises with the permission of the defendants for inspection and coloured water test on 29 December 2012 by keeping some green dye water underneath the bathtub ("CWT"). On 2 January 2013, Mr Wong visited both premises for the result of the CWT. The defendants were asked to leave the green colour water underneath the bathtub for a few more days.
12. On 6 January 2013, Poon found green coloured water dripping from the ceiling inside the toilet of P's Premises and the defendants were informed. The defendants then caused repair works at the toilet inside D's Premises to be done by replacing the bathtub, all wall tiles, floor slab and all water pipes as well as installing a water proofing layer. Such construction work started on 7 January 2013 and completed by 15 January 2013.
13. The water seepage at P's Premises stopped by mid January 2013. Wong had provided Poon with his expert report which was dated 31 January 2013 (B/31-63). On 15 February 2013, the plaintiffs had instructed their solicitors to issue a pre-action letter to the defendants and on 25 February 2013, the Statement of Claim in this case was filed in which an mandatory injunction as well as damages are sought based on a claim of nuisance and negligence.
14. A joint inspection was being conducted by Wong and Mr Alan Chan ("Chan"), an expert appointed by the defendants, on 1 June 2015 ("Joint Inspection") and a Joint Expert Statement was filed on 3 February 2016 ("Joint Statement") (B/213-232). In pursuant to the direction by this court at the Pre-Trial Review, a Scott Schedule on quantum is being prepared ("Scott Schedule") (B/268-275).
15. Parties had agreed on the list of issues to be determined in this case (B/260).
