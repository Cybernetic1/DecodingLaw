 6. On or about 16 May 2007, the plaintiff noticed seepage of water at the ceiling of the master bathroom in Flat 25G. She made a complaint to the management office of the development ("the Management Office") who in turn informed the defendants of the matter.
7. On 17 May 2007 the Management Office carried out seepage test at Flat 26G and found leakage at the pipes in the shower unit in the master bathroom, which led to water seepage to the ceiling of the master bedroom in Flat 25G.
8. On or about 28 May 2007, the defendants engaged contractors to re-pave the floor and apply water-proof layers in Flat 26G. They also re-painted the ceiling of Flat 25G. The seepage of water then ceased. The plaintiff was apparently satisfied with the repair work on that occasion.
 2nd period
 9. On 20 April 2010, almost 3 years after the seepage in 2007, the plaintiff noticed water dripping from the ceiling in her master bathroom. She made a complaint to the Management Office accordingly.
10. On 30 April 2010, the plaintiff, via the Management Office, filed a complaint to the Buildings Department/Food and Environmental Hygiene Department Joint Office ("the Joint Office") in relation to the seepage problem. The Joint Office could not ascertain the source of the seepage despite having carried out colour water test to the drainage pipes: see letter from the Joint Office to the plaintiff dated 25 May 2010.
11. On 4 May 2010, the Management Office carried out seepage test at Flat 26G and found that there was seepage at the ceiling of Flat 25G. They informed the owners of 26G to carry out inspection to the bathroom utilities and to carry out appropriate repairs.
12. By October 2010, the Joint Office still could not ascertain the source of the seepage despite further tests (including colour water test ( 「色水測試」 ); water pond test ( 「儲水測試」 ) and water spray test ( 「灑水測試」 )) conducted by the consultant engaged by it for the purpose: see the Joint Office's letter to the plaintiff dated 14 October 2010.
13. The plaintiff alleges that the water seepage had ceased about 2 weeks after the Management Office liaised with the defendants regarding the repairs.
 3rd period
 14. On 15 March 2011, the plaintiff again found water seepage at the same spot in the ceiling of her master bathroom. She again complained to the Management Office and it sent its staff to carry out inspection and confirmed the occurrence of the seepage.
15. On 18 March 2011, the plaintiff filed another complaint to the Joint Office.
16. On 23 May 2011, the Joint Office replied to the plaintiff and informed her that despite colour water test carried out by them on 8 April 2011, they could not ascertain the source of the seepage: see letter from Joint Office to the plaintiff dated 23 May 2011.
17. On 3 August 2011, the Joint Office wrote to the plaintiff again and informed her that despite extensive tests carried out by the consultant engaged by it (including colour water test, water pond test and water spray test), they still could not ascertain the source of the seepage: see letter from Joint Office to the plaintiff dated 3 August 2011.
18. The plaintiff alleges that the water seepage had ceased about 2 weeks after her complaint to the Joint Office on this occasion.
 4th period
 19. In or about early March 2012, the plaintiff found water seepage again at the same spot in her master bathroom, causing the paint and cement of the ceiling to peel off.
20. On 5 March 2012, the plaintiff filed a complaint to the Joint Office regarding the seepage.
21. On 6 April 2012, the plaintiff made a complaint to the Management Office where it sent its staff to carry out inspection at Flat 25G and confirmed that there was such seepage. The Management Office also related the matter to the defendants where the defendants informed the Management Office that they had ceased using their bathroom for one week already.
22. On 30 April 2012, the Joint Office wrote to the plaintiff and informed her that despite colour water tests carried out by them on 27 March 2012, they could not ascertain the source of the seepage: see letter from the Joint Office to the plaintiff dated 30 April 2012.
23. On 20 June 2012, the Joint Office wrote to the plaintiff and informed her that despite having carried out stage I and stage II of the investigation, the seepage still persisted and the source of the seepage could not be ascertained. They said they would proceed to stage III of the investigation: see letter from the Joint Office to the plaintiff dated 20 June 2012.
24. On 12 October 2012, the Joint Office wrote to the 1st defendant and informed him that despite stage III of the investigation carried out by the consultant engaged by it on 15 June 2012, they still could not ascertain the source of the seepage. When the consultant returned on 7 July 2012 to inspect the plaintiff's premises, they could not find any colour water used in the tests had seeped through to the plaintiff's premises. However, they noticed that the water seepage persisted at the plaintiff's premises.
25. The plaintiff alleges that the water seepage had ceased by about 20 April 2012 on this occasion.
 Subsequent actions
 26. In June 2012, the plaintiff instructed a surveyor by the name of YT Tang & Associates Limited to conduct an inspection for water seepage at her premises. However, the report was never adduced as expert evidence in this case and therefore does not form part of the consideration.
27. On 7 September 2012, the plaintiff commenced the present proceedings.
