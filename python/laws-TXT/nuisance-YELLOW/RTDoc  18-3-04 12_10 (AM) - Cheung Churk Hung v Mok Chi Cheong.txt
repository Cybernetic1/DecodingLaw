Civil procedure - summary judgment - action for trespass, unlawful interference with use and enjoyment of land and nuisance - whether defence raised triable issues
Civil procedure - striking-out - counterclaim for adverse possession - whether disclosed no reasonable cause of action and abusive of process 1. The plaintiffs took out two summonses on 31 October 2012. On one hand, the plaintiffs apply for summary judgment against the 1st, 3rd to 7th, 10th to 22nd defendants (collectively " the said defendants ") pursuant to Order 14 r.1 of the Rules of the District Court (" RDC "). On the other hand, the plaintiffs pray for an order that the counterclaim be struck out on the ground that the same discloses no reasonable cause of action against the 1st and 2nd plaintiffs and it is an abuse of the court process pursuant to Order 18 r.19 of the RDC.
2. This action concerns four lots of land in the New Territories. They are known as Lots 2460, 2461, 2462RP and 2464RP in Demarcation District 120, Yuen Long (collectively " the Land "). References to lot numbers below are references to lot numbers within the Land. The Land is situated within Lam Hou Tsuen ( 欖口村 ), Yuen Long, New Territories (" the Village "). In a nutshell, the 1st plaintiff (" Cheung ") and the 2nd plaintiff (" City Champion ") are the lessees of the Land and intend to develop the Land into an organic farm. However, the said defendants on two occasions prevented their contractor and workers from getting into the Land in an attempt to frustrate construction works on the Land. The plaintiffs' claim is based on the tort of trespass and nuisance. In their defence, the said defendants claim that they have adversely possessed of Lot 2460 since about 1997 and hence they merely avoided the trespass of Lot 2460 by the plaintiffs'contractor. They counterclaim for a declaration of a possessory title to Lot 2460.
 Background facts
 3. To resolve the applications, it is necessary to go into the background facts further. The following matters, supported by documentary evidence, are either undisputed or indisputable .
4. At the material time, Tang Wai Sun Tong (" TWST ") is the registered owner of Lots 2461, 2462RP and 2464RP. TWST is a tong of Ping Shan Tsuen in Yuen Long. TWST leased the three lots to one Tang Nim Pui (" TNP ") in April 1983 on a yearly basis and the lease is evidenced by a written tenancy agreement dated 19 April 2010. By a tenancy agreement dated 21 May 2012, TNP sublet the three lots to City Champion for a term starting from 1 June 2012 to 31 July 2016 at a monthly rent of HK$8,000.
5. The land search record shows that Tang Sam On, Tang Sum Yuen and Tang Sam Mun are the registered owners of Lot 2460. Tang Ka Hung Robert as executor of Tang Sum On took over his interest in Lot 2460 in or about November 2007. Under HCMP 2344/2010 (" the High Court Action "), the said registered owners of Lot 2460 obtained an order made by Master Ho dated 20 October 2011 (" the Order ") in the absence of any opposing evidence. The Order entitled the said registered owners to issue a Writ of Possession for the recovery of possession of Lot 2460.
6. By a letter dated 12 March 2012 handed to Messrs Kong & Tang, solicitors for the said registered owners on site, the Chief Bailiff informed the said registered owners that possession of Lot 2460 was delivered and an inventory of the goods delivered for safe custody was given.
7. By a tenancy agreement dated 8 June 2012, Tang Sam Yuen, Tang Sum Mun and Tang Ka Hung Robert leased to Cheung Lot 2460 for a term of two years at an annual rent of HK$20,000.
8. Messrs Martin Law & Co., the plaintiffs' former solicitors, posted a letter dated 16 July 2012 on Lot 2640 so as to demand the owners of such chattels found on the lot to remove such chattels within 3 days. Or else, the said registered owners might dispose of such chattels without further notice.
9. The plaintiffs rent the Land for a specific purpose. They entered into an agreement to build an organic farm on the Land. To this end, in or about June 2012, they jointly instructed one Mr Cheung For Yau (" CFY ") to be their surveyor and contractor.
10. Shortly afterwards, CFY and his workers attempted to start working in the Land but they met with the opposition by the indigenous inhabitants of the Village. The triggering event leading to the commencement of these proceedings took place on 20 July 2012 (" the July Incident "). CFY and his workers went to the Land and placed their building materials and equipment onto the Land. When they intended to fence off the Land, a group of people turned up and had a row with them. A large number of policemen attended the scene and arrests were made.
11. In the wake of the July incident, the plaintiffs found it necessary to enlist the assistance of the court on an ex-parte on notice basis with serious allegations of assault. On 2 August 2012, Deputy District Judge Norman Hui granted the plaintiffs an order against all the defendants (" the ex-parte Order ") whereby all the defendants be restrained from trespassing the Land and interfering with and/or causing nuisance to Cheung's and City Champion's use, occupation and enjoyment of the Land. The Writ herein was issued on the following day.
12. I note that in the Statement of Claim, it is pleaded that when Mr Chan Yiu Hang of Messrs Paul W. Tse served the ex-parte Order on 6 August 2012 and 10 August 2012 on the defendants, the defendants still blocked all the accesses to the Land by, among other things, mobile vehicles parked by the defendants and/or their agents. However, there is no evidence about this allegation adduced by the plaintiffs in support of the present application for summary judgment.
13. On the return day of the plaintiffs' application on 16 August 2012, the learned deputy judge granted the injunctions sought, which were more or less in the same terms of the ex-parte Order. I note that at the hearing both parties were represented and affidavit evidence was adduced from both sides.
14. The plaintiffs indicated to this court that since the inter-partes order was made on 16 August 2012, the defendants have ceased the conduct under complaint.
15. The only matter advanced as a triable issue in the skeleton submission of Mr Simon Yip, counsel for the defendants, is the defendants' claim of adverse possession of Lot 2460. At the hearing, Mr Yip confirms to me that this is the only defence relied upon by the defendants.
16. Since the defendants' claim of adverse possession is the subject matter of their counterclaim, which is being sought to be struck out by the plaintiffs, I find it logical and convenient to first deal with the plaintiffs' striking out application.
