Tort - negligence - nuisance - water leakage from premises to premises immediately below - determination of source of leakage - evaluation of expert reports 6. The plaintiffs are the registered owners and occupiers of Flat B on the 13th Floor of Maple Mansion in Taikoo Shing ("Flat 13B") whereas the defendant is the registered owner of Flat B on the 14th Floor of the same building ("Flat 14B").
7. On 9 May 2012, vacant possession of Flat 14B was delivered to the defendant as the new owner. According to the defendant, renovation work commenced on 10 May 2012 and was completed in end of July 2012.
8. During the said renovation period, the plaintiffs in about June or July 2012 first noticed signs of water leakage in Flat 13B.
9. The Building Department and Food and Environmental Hygiene Department's Joint Office ("the Joint Office") was first to be involved to carry out investigation. Moisture content test was conducted at the various suspected areas of seepage at Flat 13B.
10. The said moisture content test revealed that moisture content at the ceiling of guest bathroom, master bathroom and corridor outside guest bathroom of Flat 13B exceeded 35% which suggested apparent water seepage. For this reason, the Joint Office referred the matter to its consultant, Paul Wong Consulting Engineers Limited ("the Consultant") for further investigation.
11. The Consultant carried out investigation on four occasions: 16 November 2012, 15 January 2013, 28 February 2013 and 25 March 2013. These investigations included visual inspection, colour water test for sanitary fitments, moisture content test, and ponding test.
12. The ponding test conducted on 15 January 2013 yielded positive result; colour dye was noted at the seepage areas ("the 1st Ponding Test"). The Consultant in its report dated 27 March 2013 recommended the source of leakage should be the defective water-proofing material on the floor slab of the guest bathroom in Flat 14B.
13. This led to the issuance of the nuisance notice dated 3 May 2013 from the Joint Office to the defendant requiring her to repair the defect.
14. Supported by a receipt issued by her contractor, the defendant said remedial work was done to the water-proofing membrane of the floor slab in her guest bathroom on 14th May 2013. This was not challenged under cross-examination.
15. However, water leakage at Flat 13B still continued.
16. The Consultant was once again instructed by the Joint Office to carry out further investigation at both 13B and 14B. They did so on two occasions: 15 October 2013 and 12 November 2013. Similar tests including visual inspection, moisture content test and ponding test were conducted.
17. On 15 October 2013 ponding test was conducted at the guest bathroom of Flat 14B for the second time. This time it produced negative result, no dye was noted at the seepage areas ("the 2nd Ponding Test"). As a result, the Consultant concluded that the source of leakage could not be identified. The Joint Office then declared the case closed.
18. The plaintiffs' expert Madam Lau Shan La Rosanna ("Madam Lau") was first engaged in June 2014 to conduct inspection at Flat 13B. Thereafter, she compiled the 1st investigation report dated 29 July 2014 ("the 1st Report").
19. Joint inspections by Madam Lau and the defendant's expert Mr Cheung Wai Sum Simon ("Mr Cheung") at both Flats 13B and 14B were conducted on four occasions in 2015: 12 June 2015, 18 June 2015, 2 July 2015 and 21 September 2015. The Joint Report dated 10 November 2015 was compiled ("the Joint Report").
20. Leakage still does not stop; it persisted at least up to the time when the 1st plaintiff made her witness statement in December 2015. This was not challenged under cross-examination.
