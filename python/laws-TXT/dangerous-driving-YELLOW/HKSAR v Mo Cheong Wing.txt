Criminal sentencing - road traffic offences - dangerous driving causing death - moving or interfering with vehicle involved in serious accident causing death - vehicle driven by defendant (who had consumed some whisky) moved, nudging forward friend (deceased) who leaned against bonnet, and when deceased refused to give way and instead climbed onto bonnet, vehicle accelerated and then braked, throwing deceased onto road, causing fatal head injury; deceased then inspected body and drove away 1. It was a drunken horseplay that went horribly wrong. At about 1 or 2 in the morning on the 12 day of October 2016, Mr Mo Cheong Wing, a 24-year-old man, and several friends, including one Mr Kong Kin Fung, ("the deceased"), gathered for drinks at a bar in Ashley Road, Tsim Sha Tsui. There they stayed until 4 to 5 am. By then, the defendant, as admitted by his counsel, had consumed two to three glasses of whisky. The bar was supposed to close at 4 am.
2. At about 6 am, the defendant boarded his vehicle and was about to drive away. The deceased, who did not wish the reverie to end there and then, stood in front of the defendant's vehicle in a bid to stop the defendant from leaving. From the CCTV footages one can see the deceased lean his back against the defendant's bonnet while paying attention to his mobile phone. Nonetheless, the vehicle began to move, nudging the deceased forward. The deceased refused to give way, instead turned around and climbed onto the bonnet of the vehicle, the vehicle then accelerated and then braked, throwing the deceased onto the road.
3. While the deceased was lying motionless on the road, the defendant approached and inspected the body before driving away. That was before the police arrived.
4. The deceased as a result suffered from a head injury with profound neurological damage and cardiac arrest. He was certified dead on 14 October 2016.
