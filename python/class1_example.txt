12. The following material facts, which are taken from documentary and unchallenged evidence, are not in dispute.
13. Since about December 2010, the plaintiff discovered that water was emerging along the foot of the walls in the
dining room, corridor, and the wall in the master bedroom near the master bathroom of Flat 6A. Since early January
2011, the plaintiff discovered that water was emerging from underneath the bathtub in the master bathroom and the
ceiling in the master bathroom of Flat 6A. Since about March 2011, the plaintiff further discovered that water was
emerging from the master bathroom and the walls of the dining room of Flat 6A. Since about mid-March 2011, the
plaintiff also noticed foul smell in the master bathroom of Flat 6A.

14. On 11 April 2011, a blue dye test was conducted by a Mr Poon, a plumber, to the flushing cistern of the toilets
in Flat 7A. On 16 April 2011, the plaintiff found blue colour water underneath the bathtub in the master bathroom of
Flat 6A.
15. On 21 April 2011, an orange dye test was conducted by Mr Poon to the flushing cistern of the toilets in Flat 7A.
On 24 April 2011, the plaintiff found yellowish orange colour seeped out at the foot of the wall in the dining room in
Flat 6A. Meanwhile, a Mr Kong of the Management Office of the Building ("the MO") reported the water seepage in
Flat 6A to the Joint Office of the Buildings Department/Food and Environmental Hygiene Department Joint Office
(respectively "the Joint Office", "the BD" and "the FEHD").
16. Pausing here, I note that the orange dye test conducted in Flat 7A on 21 April 2011 and the discovery of water
seepage in Flat 6A on 24 April 2011 were referred to in the following documents:-

(1) Firstly, in the Survey Report prepared by Great East Asia Surveyors & Consultants Co
Ltd ("GEA") dated 30 April 2011 ("GEA's Report") (see below), it is stated that:- "On 21st April 2011,
the Management Office arranged a technician to carry out the dye test on [Flat 7A]. Yellow colour
water was found on the floor of the Dining room (near the Bathroom) [of Flat 6A] after two days".
(2) Secondly, in the email from the plaintiff to the defendants dated 22 July 2011, the plaintiff
stated that:- "...... plumber Mr. Poon had applied orange dyes & blue dyes in your washroom, both
come out in my dining room & washroom a few days after application under the surveillance of the
Customer Service of Astoria in end Apr. I am sure you are aware of the results ..."
The defendants did not reply to this email.
(3) Thirdly, it is stated in the letter from the Joint Office to the plaintiff's solicitors dated 18 September 2015
that on 21 April 2011, a Mr. Kong of the MO reported the water seepage in Flat 6A to the Joint Office.
17. In April 2011, the plaintiff engaged GEA to assess the damage caused by the water seepage to Flat 6A. On 30
April 2011, GEA prepared the GEA's Report.
18. On 12 August 2011, the FEHD inspected Flat 6A and found two seepage areas in Flat 6A, namely, at the
ceiling in the master bedroom and the gap between the wood parquet tile and wall edge near the guest bathroom.
The moisture content at the ceiling in the master bedroom was found to be above 35%. On the same day, the
FEHD conducted colour water test in all the drainage outlets in the master bathroom, guest bathroom and kitchen
of Flat 7A.
19. On 15 August 2011, the plaintiff issued the writ in this action with the statement of claim.
20. On 19 August 2011, the FEHD visited Flat 6A. The plaintiff submitted tissue and cardboard which were stained
with colour to FEHD for analysis. According to the plaintiff, the samples were collected from the gap between the
wood parquet tile and wall edge near the guest bathroom.
21. On 31 August 2011, the FEHD visited Flat 6A again. The plaintiff's mother submitted 2 bags of cardboard with
pink colour to FEHD for analysis. According to the plaintiff's mother, the cardboards were collected from the gap
between the wood parquet tile and wall edge near the guest bathroom.
22. According to the government laboratory reports respectively dated 9 and 14 September 2011, colour water was
found in the samples submitted by the plaintiff and the plaintiff's mother, which indicated that the floor drain in the
master bedroom of Flat 7A was defective causing dampness at the gap between the wood parquet tile and wall
edge near the guest bathroom of Flat 6A.
23. On 14 September 2011, the FEHD visited Flat 6A again for a review of the colour water test. The moisture
content at the ceiling in the master bathroom of Flat 6A was found to be above 35% and colour stain was detected
on the bottle traps on the external walls of 7/F. The plaintiff submitted samples which she said were collected from
the gap between the wood parquet tile and wall edge near the guest bathroom to FEHD for analysis.
24. On 6 October 2011, the plaintiff engaged Hong Kong Building Inspection & Structural Diagnostic Ltd
("HKBISDL") to inspect Flat 6A. On 10 January 2012, HKBISDL prepared a water seepage report on Flat 6A.
25. On 8 October 2011, the defendants engaged Wong Shun Tai, Stewart of Proficient Surveyors & Co ("Mr
Wong") to inspect Flat 7A and Flat 6A. He conducted a green dye test to the floor and floor drain of the guest toilet
and a bluish brown dye test to the basin, toilet bowl and bathtub in the master bathroom of Flat 7A but did not
conduct any dye test on Flat 6A. He also measured the moisture content of the ceiling and walls in the master
bathroom of Flat 6A. On 11 November 2011, Mr Wong prepared a survey report ("Mr Wong's Survey Report") in
which he opined that water leaked from the fresh water pipes concealed in the walls in the master bathroom of Flat
6A at a position between the water heater and the faucet of the bathtub, that water accumulated in the floor recess
underneath the bathtub of the master bedroom of Flat 6A and that water seeped along the floor slab of master
bathroom to reach the timber flooring outside the guest bathroom of Flat 6A. I shall have more to say about Mr
Wong's opinion contained in this survey report when I analyse his opinion contained in the Joint Report dated 11
August 2015 ("the Joint Report") (see Section E below).
26. On 17 October 2011, the FEHD visited Flat 6A again and found that the moisture content at the ceiling in the
master bathroom of Flat 6A was below 35%. The plaintiff submitted to FEHD tissue and paper samples which she

claimed were collected from the gap between the wood parquet tile and wall edge near the guest bathroom for
analysis as suspected fluorescent colour was detected on the cement between the tiles in the guest bathroom of
Flat 6A.
27. On 19 October 2011, the FEHD served a Nuisance Notice on the defendants ("the 1st Nuisance Notice"),
stating that the nuisance was "water seepage through the branch waste pipe connecting to the outlet of vertical
floor drain in the master bathroom at [Flat 7A] to the skirting of living room of [Flat 6A]." The defendants were
demanded to repair satisfactorily the branch waste pipe connecting to the outlet of vertical floor drain in the master
bathroom of Flat 7A within 14 days.
28. It is the defendants' case that upon receiving the 1st Nuisance Notice, they blocked the branch waste pipe in
the master bathroom of Flat 7A.
29. On 16 November 2011, the FEHD visited Flat 7A and found that the floor drain in the master bathroom of Flat
7A was blocked and the Nuisance Notice complied with.
30. On 24 November 2011, the FEHD visited Flat 6A again and found that the moisture content at the gap between
wood parquet tile and lower portion of wall near guest bathroom of Flat 6A was above 35%. On 15 December 2011,
considering the persistence of the water seepage, the FEHD referred the matter to the BD for Stage III professional
investigation.
31. For the purpose of Stage III professional investigation, the Joint Office engaged Multiple Surveyors Ltd ("MSL")
to conduct various tests on Flat 7A and Flat 6A. At the visual inspection/initial investigation stage on 7 January and
16 February 2012 respectively, MSL noted that the condition of seepage was consistently all day long at the ceiling
of master bathroom and guest bathroom and the wall of living room of Flat 6A and that the moisture content at the
ceiling in master bathroom and wall of living room of Flat 6A was above 35%. After the visual inspection/initial
investigation, MSL recommended to proceed with further investigation. As part of the further investigation, on 9
March 2012, MSL conducted the following tests on Flat 7A:-
(1) Water ponding test with acid red ("AR") dye applied to the bathtub and its enclosing walls of master
bathroom;
(2) Water ponding test with fluorescent sodium ("FS") dye applied to bathtub and its enclosing walls of
guest bathroom; and
(3) Water ponding test with brilliant scarlet ("BS") dye applied to the floor slab of the guest bathroom.
32. Based on the above tests, MSL prepared an Inspection Report dated 15 May 2012 ("MSL's Inspection Report").
In MSL's Inspection Report, it is stated that MSL observed FS at the wall of the living room of Flat 6A on 9 and 10
March, 3 and 27 April 2012 and at the ceiling in the master bathroom of Flat 6A on 3 and 27 April 2012. MSL
concluded that the source of leakage was from the floor underneath the bathtub and its enclosing walls in the guest
bathroom of Flat 7A and that it was not likely that the leakage was due to water supply pipe leakage or rain water
leakage. Photos Nos 13 to 24 attached to MSL's Inspection Report 3 are particularly helpful as they clearly show
the florescent effect of FS dye under UV light at the wall of the living room and the ceiling in the master bathroom of
Flat 6A on the dates specified above. MSL recommended the Joint Office to issue an advisory letter to the owners
of Flat 7A to abate the seepage nuisance.
33. On or about 4 March 2012, the plaintiff and her parents moved out of Flat 6A. Since 21 April 2012, water supply
to Flat 6A had been suspended.
34. On 19 July 2012, based on the recommendation of the BD, the FEHD served a 2nd Nuisance Notice on the
defendants, stating that the nuisance was "water seepage through the floor slab underneath bathtub and its
enclosing walls in the guest bathroom of [Flat 7A] to the ceilings and walls of [Flat 6A]". The defendants were
demanded to repair satisfactorily the floor slab underneath the bathtub and its enclosing walls in the guest
bathroom of Flat 7A "by suitably maintaining and providing well-protected water proofing material to the said floor
slab and walls to prevent water seepage to [Flat 6A]" within 21 days. 4 It should be noted that the 2nd Nuisance
Notice alluded to the absence of water proofing material at the floor slab and walls of the guest bathroom of Flat 7A
as being the reason for the water seepage. Although the 2nd Nuisance did not specify what "ceilings and walls" in
Flat 6A were being referred to, judging from MSL"s Report which the Joint Office must have relied on, it is
reasonable to infer that the "walls" referred to was the wall of the living room of Flat 6A and that the "ceilings"
referred to was the "ceiling" of the master bathroom of Flat 6A.
35. It is the defendants' case that upon receiving the 2nd Nuisance Notice, they engaged a contractor to cover the
floor slab of the guest bathroom of Flat 7A and apply water-proof material at around the bath tub rims. Similar work
was done to the master bathroom of Flat 7A.
36. On 25 September 2012, the FEHD visited Flat 6A again and found that the moisture content of the seepage
areas were below 35%. However, the plaintiff reported that a new seepage area at Flat 6A, which was located at
the lower portion of the wall in the passageway near the guest bathroom, the moisture content of which was above
35%. On the same day, the FEHD also visited Flat 7A and found signs of repair on the floor slab underneath the
bathtub of the guest bathroom.
37. On 2 November 2012, the FEHD visited Flat 6A and confirmed that the moisture content of the affected areas

was below 35%. Thus, the Revised 2nd Nuisance Notice was found to have been complied with.
38. On 6 November 2012, the Joint Office sent a final reply letter to the plaintiff and the defendants which were in
substantially identical terms. In the letter, the Joint Office (1) referred to the Revised 2nd Nuisance Notice whereby
the defendants were demanded to repair satisfactorily the floor slab underneath the bathtub and its enclosing walls
in the guest bathroom of Flat 7A; (2) stated that it had visited Flat 6A and found that the moisture content of the
seepage areas were below 35%; however since there was a new seepage area located at the lower portion of the
wall in the passageway near the guest bedroom, the moisture content of which was above 35%, the Joint Office
would need to engage a consultant company for further investigation; and (3) stated that on 2 November 2012 it
visited Flat 6A again and found that the moisture content of the affected areas were below 35% and thus the
Revised 2nd Nuisance Notice had been complied with.
