The transfer decks consisted of many wheels to reduce friction of and thereby aid the ease of plank 1 of cargoes being pushed along their surface 2 .\par}

The warehouse and its facilities belonged to Cathay and not defendant. All warehousemen on joining defendant are required to attend induction safety training designed by Cathay on safety matters to be noted at the terminal, including safety guidelines to work on transfer decks and avoid slipping etc. Mr Cheung produced records of plaintiff attending such induction safety course on 5 Aug 2013 to his witness statement.\par}

It is, of course, not uncommon for workers performing manual handling duties to over-exert and injure themselves. But, had plaintiff over-exerted himself with only one co-worker to assist him in "pushing" plank of cargo as allegedly recorded in the report, he was, I think, more likely to injure himself in lower back than other parts of the body such as ankles now recorded in plaintiff's medical reports and records before me.\par}

But nowhere did Mr Cheung mention of such material facts of the fill-up in his 2 witness statements.\par}

Hence, his claim at paragraph 5 of his witness statement that the gaps had their width as small as only 2 to 3 inches was plainly incorrect and a gross under-estimation.\par}

He agreed that upper photo at p.E7 and lower photo at p.E8 showed what the gaps were like at the time of the alleged accident. But for the fill-up, there was, Mr Cheung conceded in the box, {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul risk} of slipping and/or tripping to workers at the time of the alleged accident.\par}

These many wheels measures {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i \strike0 \ul0 4 inches in diameter} on photo No.4 in annex 4 photos, he agreed, and any worker stepping and skipping on them is {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i \strike0 \ul0 liable} to slip or fall.\par}

The divers measurements of the wheels and the gaps of the transfer decks as admitted by him make it likely, I think, that plaintiff could have his left foot skipped on one wheel of the deck and fallen into the 1st gap as alleged.\par}

On plaintiff's evidence in the box, as many as two of his co-workers were standing at the back of the 5th plank pushing it towards his direction. And the 5th plank had {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul not} crossed the 1st gap by the alleged accident. As such, his two co-workers must exert {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i \strike0 \ul0 sufficiently strong} force {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i \strike0 \ul0 together} to {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i \strike0 \ul0 get it over} the 1st gap.\par}

By all means, the injuries he sustained were not, I think, as serious as to stop him altogether from working immediately. As he added in the box, he did not encounter cargo as heavy as the 5th plank for the rest of the day or next day. He applied herbal oil on returning home hoping not to absent from work. And he was told he could only report to superior with medical certificate as proof.\par}

On further probing, he changed to answer not recalling what he said over the phone.\par}

\qj \hyphpar0 \cbpat0 {\sa60\sb60\li0\ri0\fi0\sl288\slmult1 \f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 42.} I should say that I have fully taken into account the above significant departure from his evidence in assessing plaintiff's credibility below (there were various other departures, retractions and contradictions of plaintiff's evidence in the box which I do not reproduce herein but I have equally taken them into account).\par}

\qj \hyphpar0 \cbpat0 {\sa60\sb60\li0\ri0\fi0\sl288\slmult1 \f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 43.} At the same time, I do not find Mr Cheung's taking of the report satisfactory either. It was not a simultaneous or a verbatim account of plaintiff's words. It was, admitted by him, a summary or precis prepared by him of what the plaintiff orally told him earlier during a 10-minute-long call but, at the end of the day, he only wrote 4 short lines of Chinese on it.\par}

And that was the case notwithstanding it was Mr Cheung's concession that plaintiff's communication skills were limited and that plaintiff had turned to some so-called alleged "irrelevant" matters during the call.\par}

Its reference to injury to "left" ankle only of plaintiff differs from " {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i \strike0 \ul0 bilateral} " ankle injury found at A&E of NLH two days after the alleged accident 8 . Under cross-examination, Mr Cheung also recalled of plaintiff saying to him " {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i \strike0 \ul0 hit} " during the call but such important word was nowhere found in the report.\par}

However, he was not their authors and cannot be in a position to answer questions on them. Many of these came from his {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i \strike0 \ul0 treating} doctors and nurses, whose focus was, I think, more likely to be plaintiff's injuries than the course of the alleged accident.\par}

For example, by no means was plaintiff required to engage in "lifting" of planks of cargoes at the warehouse, if such word is taken {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i \strike0 \ul0 literally} . Neither did plaintiff "push" the 5th plank {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i \strike0 \ul0 the moment} before the alleged impact, but, at the same time, his duties could generally be described as "pushing" or "moving" the planks along the surface of transfer decks to conveyor belts.\par}

As such, there is no issue of fallback position for Mr Pun either.\par}

But medical report from A&E of NLH gave {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul no} such alleged examination or alleged redness of his right knee.\par}

\qj \hyphpar0 \cbpat0 {\sa60\sb60\li0\ri0\fi0\sl288\slmult1 \f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 56.} As were recorded in medical reports before me, the plaintiff apparently complained specifically to Dr Lau about his {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i \strike0 \ul0 two knees} . In medical report of O&T of PMH, when he was {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i \strike0 \ul0 first} seen on 24 Feb 2015, the plaintiff also complained of right "leg" pain after injury on 8 Oct 2013 and complained of persistent right "knee" and right "ankle" pain after the injury. Apparently, he could afterwards distinguish the different body parts and complained separately.\par}

\qj \hyphpar0 \cbpat0 {\sa60\sb60\li0\ri0\fi0\sl288\slmult1 \f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 57.} In any event, I do not believe any alleged misunderstanding as allegedly explained by plaintiff could have lasted as long as close to 9 months and not corrected by plaintiff with so many different doctors and medical staff of NLH on so many sessions.\par}

The word "strained" should particularly be noted. Right ankle "sprain" was also put down as the reason for referral to O&T in letter of referral issued to plaintiff dated 30 Dec 2013 by A&E of NLH.\par}

\qj \hyphpar0 \cbpat0 {\sa60\sb60\li0\ri0\fi0\sl288\slmult1 \f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 59.} By contrast, it was by his {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i \strike0 \ul0 first} appointment on 24 Feb 2015 at O&T of PMH that the plaintiff was recorded to have belatedly used the word "hit" for the {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i \strike0 \ul0 first} time by saying that "his {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i \strike0 \ul0 right} leg was hit by load of frozen salmon during the injury".\par}

And such breaches caused and/or contributed to the alleged accident.\par}

I have also reminded myself that the standard is one of reasonable care only. Nevertheless, having considered all circumstances prevailing at the time of the alleged accident, the presence of the gaps and wheels (on such measurements I found above) on the surface of the transfer decks did pose, I think, a real and foreseeable risk of serious injury to defendant's workers pushing heavy planks of cargoes at the warehouse.\par}

\qj \hyphpar0 \cbpat0 {\sa60\sb60\li0\ri0\fi0\sl288\slmult1 \f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 65.} Such gaps ought, in my view, to have been filled-up before or at the time of the alleged accident. Mr Cheung originally claimed in his witness statement that defendant at no time received any complaint or opinion from workers concerning the aforesaid risk. And Cathay would not allow {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i \strike0 \ul0 wooden} plates or blocks to be so placed on the gaps as it would obstruct passage of goods.\par}

Granted that the fill-up was done, Cathay apparently consented to the fill-up or allowed it to be done. I think Mr Cheung just made up excuses to mislead this court and I hold that the fill-up could be arranged before the alleged accident despite defendant was not the owner of the warehouse or its facilities.\par}

\qj \hyphpar0 \cbpat0 {\sa60\sb60\li0\ri0\fi0\sl288\slmult1 \f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 67.} Equally, on being cross-examined with lower photo at p.E13, Mr Cheung agreed that the horizontal line area marked by the colours of yellow and black 13 was one of the gaps but he insisted that such {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i \strike0 \ul0 coloured labelling} was, at the time of the alleged accident, {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul already} there on all the gaps to provide warning due to complaint or opinion given by workers to Cathay.\par}

Were they {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul already} there on the day of the alleged accident, I see no good reason not for him to have raised it earlier (and not for defence to have pleaded it). I do not believe in him on this point and find the position to be otherwise. The gaps ought, I think, to have been so marked up by coloured labels before the alleged accident to serve as warning to defendant's workers at the warehouse.\par}

But Mr Cheung was {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul not} directly involved in such training. Neither was plaintiff cross-examined about their {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i \strike0 \ul0 detailed contents} . The mass of "safety induction" materials of Cathay before me 14 was {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul not} put to plaintiff either, let alone its version date was Feb 2004 15 i.e. {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i \strike0 \ul0 after} the alleged accident. In any event, I do not think any allegation of insufficient training, instructions and/or supervision, if made out at all, caused and/or contributed to the alleged accident.\par}

At best, {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i \strike0 \ul0 only} injuries to his {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i \strike0 \ul0 left} ankle were caused by the 1st gap as only his {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i \strike0 \ul0 left} foot fell into it.

His {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i \strike0 \ul0 right knee} was, I find, {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul not} hurt in the alleged accident.\par}

In particular, the partial tear in anterior cruciate ligament and tear of medial meniscus of {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i \strike0 \ul0 right knee} suffered by plaintiff (and shown on MRI scan) has, I find, {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul nothing} to do with the alleged accident.\par}

I find that the plaintiff should have recovered well from his ankles injuries in the alleged accident. He should not be suffering disabling symptoms. His symptoms are mild at the very most. He should have no difficulty in his activities of daily living. The appropriate sick leave should be no more than 3 months. And plaintiff should be able to return to his pre-accident job.

First, the injuries recorded at A&E of NLH on 10 Oct 2013 were indeed minor. X-ray right ankle showed no fracture. Both ankles of plaintiff were found tender and swollen only.

A soft tissue injury without obvious external wound should not, I agree with Dr Ho, result in such diffuse lower limb numbness.\par}

This was the monthly earnings figure for the last month before the alleged accident put down in Form 2 which plaintiff himself agreed in cross-examination.\par}

\qj \hyphpar0 \cbpat0 {\sa60\sb60\li0\ri0\fi0\sl288\slmult1 \f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i0 \strike0 \ul0 85.} On being cross-examined on paragraph 4 of his witness statement, plaintiff admitted that he did not receive diligent allowance as much as $2,580 stated therein at the time of the alleged accident, on top of basic salary of $11,000. Hence, he himself did not support the monthly earnings figure of $13,580 suggested by Mr Pun.\par}

He could return to his pre-accident job despite it. And there is no evidence of his facing real difficulty in finding alternative employment in the labour market as he never attempted doing so after expiry of his excessive sick leave.\par}

I therefore make an additional award of $7,125 here.\par}

Giving credit for employees' compensation in the sum of {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b \i0 \strike0 \ul0 $295,181.57} he has received, plaintiff recovers nothing 22 even if he succeeds on liability in this common law action.
