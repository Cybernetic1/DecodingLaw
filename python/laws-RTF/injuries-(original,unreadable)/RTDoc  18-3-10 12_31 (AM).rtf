There had been a shoe cabinet there which had been removed during the renovation works and some holes had been left on the wall. P was doing touch up work there on 17\u8205\?

Additionally, P claims that the ladder from which he fell off on 17\u8205\? July 2013 was supplied by D.

Chao was to live at the premises after the completion of the interior renovation works.\par}

On the evidence of D, which I accept, I find that the actual works commenced around the end of April\u8205\? 2013.

He said that his working hours were decided and arranged by D. His working hours were fixed from 9\u8205\?\u8239\?am to 6\u8205\?\u8239\?pm from Monday to Saturday and that if requested by D, he might work on a Sunday or public holiday.

He also said that the ladder from which he fell off on 17\u8205\? July 2013 and which he had used at the premises was supplied by P. P also said that he had been using two worn out ladders while working at the premises which had been supplied by D.

D's evidence was that as a contractor for renovation works, he would sub-contract different parts of the work to sub-contractors and supervise them to ensure the quality of the work in a timely fashion.

The undisputed evidence is that Chao contacted D in about April 2013 to ask him to do the renovation works at the premises. D agreed to do so. D in turn contacted and hired different sub-contractors for different parts of the renovation works. He listed the different sub-contractors in Annexure\u8205\? 1 to his witness statement which stood as his evidence in chief. On D's evidence, P was one such sub-contractor responsible for the painting works in the premises.\par}

Ah Pun in fact made a witness statement but P did not call him to give evidence. The explanation P gave for not calling Ah Pun to give evidence was that Ah Pun was unwilling to testify for him as he did not wish other contractors to know that he came to court to give evidence against a contractor. He said that it was possible that other contractors may not hire him in future if he testified.\par}

I\u8205\? do not believe P on this matter. Ah Pun had no difficulty in making a witness statement to P's solicitors. He must have known that his witness statement would be supplied to D.\par}

I accept and prefer his evidence to the evidence of Ng\u8205\? Hin\u8205\? Chun and Wong\u8205\? Ming\u8205\? Bun on this matter.

Chao was sure that P was paid in cash by D on that occasion but he did not know how much he was actually paid by D on that occasion. D gave evidence that he paid P the sum of $19,000 on 29\u8205\?

He said that for the work that he did at the premises he was paid in two instalments by D. In re-examination, P said that the first instalment was paid to him on 18\u8205\? June 2013 when he received $20,000 from P. The second instalment was when he received $21,000 from D on 19\u8205\? July 2013. In re-examination he also said that he received a further sum of $3,000 on 19\u8205\? July 2013 from D so that he could go back to his hometown to take a rest after his discharge from hospital. That was his explanation for the total sum of $24,000 which he said he received from D on 19\u8205\? July 2013. When it was pointed out to P that in his witness statement he mentioned that he received $24,000 on 19\u8205\? July 2013 as salary, he tried to explain the discrepancy by saying that he lumped the sum of $21,000 salary and the sum of $3,000 gratuitous payment that D gave him on the same occasion. I\u8205\? would observe that he clearly said in his witness statement that the whole sum of $24,000 he received on 19\u8205\? July 2013 was the balance of the salary that he had received from P.

This was a post entry record made by the policeman. D was described by the policeman as P's colleague. It is also recorded there "Employer Yee Hing Renovation". The word "Employer" was written in English whereas Yee Hing Renovation ("Yee Hing") was written in Chinese. Mr\u8205\? Lee relied on this entry as showing that P was employed by D.

It is highly unlikely that either D or Chao would have spoken to the policeman in English. The notebook does not record who informed the policeman of Yee Hing and what was actually said in Chinese for the policeman to write the word "Employer" in English. The notebook entry also records that "Inft (flat owner) [Chao]" which seems to suggest that the informant was Chao.\par}

In my view, P's solicitors should have called the policeman to give evidence if they wished to rely on the entry in support of P's case that he was an employee rather than a sub-contractor. There is no evidence that D made an admission to the policeman that P was employed by Yee Hing. As I have said, the entry does not show that there was a clear and unequivocal admission made by D that P was employed by Yee Hing.\par}

May to 18\u8205\? June 2013 and then from 9 to 17\u8205\? July 2013. He did not work at the premises in the period from 18\u8205\? June 2013 to 9\u8205\? July 2013 which was a period of about 3\u8205\? weeks. His evidence was that sometimes he rested. He also said that he did not go to work at the premises during that period of about 3\u8205\? weeks. There is no satisfactory explanation for his absence for such a long period. If he were a casual worker and an employee of D, it is, in my view, unlikely that he would have been permitted to take about 3\u8205\? weeks off work during that period. However, as a sub-contractror he was free to come and go as he liked provided the works were completed on time.\par}

September 2013 for submission to the Employees Compensation Division of the Labour Department, P described Chao as his employer and filled in Chao's name and address in the form as the name and address of his employer. He filled in D's name as the name of the principal contractor. D's case is that he was in fact the principal contractor with P being one of his sub-contractors for the works at the premises.\par}

October 2013 to enquire about the progress of his claim, he was asked questions which he answered and he was then told that he had filled in the name of his employer wrongly. He was given another appointment with them for 22\u8205\? November 2013. The name of his employer was changed from Chao to D.\par}

His explanation was that he thought that by the term 'employer' in the form it meant the person who paid the money. Therefore, he thought that it meant the owner of the premises. I\u8205\? do not believe him. He said in evidence that he had known all along that D was his employer and if that is right, I find it inconceivable that he would have misunderstood what the word 'employer' meant in the form.\par}

P denied that he ever asked D to collaborate with him to claim $180,000 from Chao. On this dispute of fact, I prefer the evidence of D to the evidence of P. I\u8205\? believe D and disbelieve P. I\u8205\? find that on his discharge from hospital on 19\u8205\? July 2013 P did ask D to collaborate with him to claim $180,000 from Chao but that D immediately refused to do so.\par}

P went on to say that when D received the two sick leave certificates on that day D verbally promised P that he would pay four-fifths of his salary, ie the periodical payments under the Employees' Compensation Ordinance. From his witness statement it would appear that P was saying that the two sick leave certificates were given to D on the same day in mid-August 2014.

He was of the view that P had reached maximum medical improvement. His prognosis of P was fair to good. Dr\u8205\?

His view was that as subsequent X-rays including the up-dated X-rays taken in the joint examination showed good bone healing, sick leave up to November\u8205\? 2013 should have been adequate. He was of the view that the extended sick leave granted up to 27\u8205\? August 2014 was not justified for P's uncomplicated and undisplaced rib fractures.\par}

Logically, if the finding is that the plaintiff could have gone back to work after three months, that is the period that is relevant to the assessment and award of pre-trial loss of earnings and no other. Sick leave certificates are no more than a piece of evidence that has to be evaluated in the light of all the available evidence including medical evidence before the court. As Rogers V-P observed in: {\f10 \fs20 \cf1 \b0 \i \strike0 \ul0 Choy Wai Chung v Chun Wo Construction & Engineering Co Ltd} (unrep., CACV 172/2004, [2005] HKEC 1077) at para.9, the judge cannot be bound by the mere issue of sick leave certificates: the issuance of such certificates would be primarily because of the subjective symptoms reported to the doctors by the plaintiff."\par}

I\u8205\? am prepared to adopt $21,400 as the average monthly earnings of P for the purposes of calculating loss of earnings.
